# Roselyn S. Ramos

Hi! My name is Roselyn S. Ramos, currently living in Cambinocot, Cebu City.
I studied in University Of Cebu main campus taking up Bachelor of Science in Information and Technology. 
My high lights is that I have a little background about front end developing but I am more interested in Quality Assurance testing and Project Leading.
My lowlights is that I still need to study and learn a lot about my high lights.
